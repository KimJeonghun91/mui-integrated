# my-mui/core-downloads-tracker

This package does not contain any code.
It is used solely to track number of downloads of my-mui/material and my-mui/joy (the only packages that depend on it) and help us determine the number of users of my-mui/base.
Counting downloads is done by npm (as for every other package).
